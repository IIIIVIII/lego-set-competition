# lego-set-competition
The "Lego Set Competition" project simulates a competition among various Lego sets. Each Lego set has different attributes such as ID, name, price, number of pieces, and theme. The project analyzes these attributes to determine which Lego set wins the competition. The main components of the project are:

Main.java: The entry point of the application. It initializes the Lego set competition and displays the results.
LegoSetCompetition.java: Contains the core logic of the competition, defining the attributes of Lego sets and methods to compare them and determine the winner.
